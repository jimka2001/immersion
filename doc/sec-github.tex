You will start with existing code in a central repository of code, hosted by
GitHub on the cloud.  You will download (clone) a copy of this
repository, edit existing code, and create new code.

GitHub is a web based service which hosts thousands of projects, small
and large, in the cloud.  Typically, users have a development
environment on their local computer (laptop or desktop) and
periodically upload and download changes to the cloud.

The URL \url{https://github.com/jimka2001/immersion}, is the public
entry point to the GitHub project which we will work on in this
atelier.

You must create an account on GitHub (if you don't have one already).
This will be done in Section~\ref{sec.setup}.


\subsection{Getting Started}
\label{sec.setup}

I recommend you use the Chrome web browser.

We need to set up the development environment.  The following steps should
help.

\subsection{Account Creation}
  
Create a GitHub account using an abstract user name.  Don't use your
real name.  Instead use an artificial name use as your name from
instagram or other social media.  You may also make up a completely
new name as long as no other person has already used that name on
GitHub.  \url{https://github.com/join}.  To complete the process of
creating a GitHub account you may need to authenticate using your
mobile phone.

\subsection{Open the Repository}
  
Open \url{https://github.com/jimka2001/immersion} with your web browser.

\subsection{Fork yourself a copy}

Fork the repository.  This gives you a private copy.  You will make changes
necessary changes in the code using this private copy.

\noindent \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{github-fork-repo.png}



\subsection{Open a Python File}
  
\begin{enumerate}
\item Navigate to \code{src/hello.py} to see something like this.

\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{find-hello.png}



\item Click \code{hello.py} to open the file in an editor pane.  You
  should see something like what is shown here:

\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{hello-function.png}


\item Open the file by clicking \code{github.dev} not \code{Edit in place}.

\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{github-dev.png}


\item You may need to wait while setting up.

\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{github-dev-setup.png}

\item If this setup seems to never finish, it may mean you need to use Chrome as your web browser.


\item GitHub may ask for permission to see your repository.  Click on \textbf{Allow}.
  
\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{github-ask-permission.png}
  

\item GitHub may ask for your GitHub ID.  Normally you just select the default one.
  
\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{github-ask-user-name.png}

\item Finally, the GitHub development environment should be opened.
  
\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{github-dev-opened.png}



\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Set up the Editor}
  
\begin{enumerate}

\item Now you can edit your code but you cannot run nor test it.

\item Find the icon \includegraphics[width=2cm]{run-debug.png} on the left hand side of the browser window.   Press that icon to see the following message.

\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{continue.png}

\item Press continue, and you should see a prompt such as the following to create a code space.   

\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{create-code-space.png}

\item Select \includegraphics[width=8cm]{select-create.png}.

\item You may be asked how many cores do you want.

\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{select-cores.png}

\item You should select the minimum: \includegraphics[width=7cm]{two-cores.png}.

\item You'll probably now need to reopen the \code{hello.py} file.

\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{re-open-python-file.png}

\item You may be asked to install the Python extension.  Press \textbf{Install}.

\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{install-python-extension.png}


\item Wait until it finishes installing.
  

\item When it finishes installing, you should see something like this:

\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{python-extension.png}

\item Reopen the explorer: \includegraphics[width=7cm]{explorer2.png}, and select the \code{hello.py} file.

\noindent\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{explorer.png}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Make a Sample Run}

Find the icon \includegraphics[height=1.0cm]{run-triangle.png}
  in the top-right of the editor window.  Click the triangle, to see a sample run/execution of the code.

\noindent\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{hello-terminal-output.png}


\subsection{Challenges for the Student}

Understanding errors and debugging is difficult, but it is part of programming.

Experiment with the simple pieces of code in the above sections.
Insert spaces and press the run button.  Look at the error messages
produced. Remove some quotation marks or parentheses (leaving
unbalanced quotations marks or parentheses)---again look at what error
messages you see when you try to run invalid code.


\begin{enumerate}
\item Remove and add some spaces at the beginning of a line.
\item Change the indentation.
\item Unbalance the parentheses.
\item Unbalance the quotation marks.
\item Put extra spaces inside the quotation marks.
\item Change the name of the \code{hello} function at definition site or call site.
\item Figure out how to undo your changes in the editor to make the code work again.
\end{enumerate}
